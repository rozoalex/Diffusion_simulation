# Diffusion_simulation
This is a Matlab simulation of the smog particles concentration.
The smog concentration is modeled with the diffusion equation in one dimension: dC(x,t)/dt=D*(d/dx)*dC(x,t)/dx 
where D is a constant, x is the distance on x-axis, t is the time and the C is the concentration of particles. 
C is a function of x and t.
